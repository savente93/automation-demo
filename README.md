# Github workflow automation demo

This repository is just a simple skeleton for showing off some common github automation tricks. You can also use it to get started with your own. Here are a few of the things it is setup to demonstrate (which might not copy over if you use the repo as a template, I'm not sure)

## pre-commit
The repository has a few pre-commit hooks configured. to see which ones exactly and how they are configured you can read the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. Some prominent are `ruff`, `yamlfmt` and `black`.

## Projects
This is one of the aspects that might not be coppied over if you use this repo as a template, but you can create your own for free. You can find how to do so in the GH docs.

## Workflow automations
When you've enabled a project for your repository you can add a few free workflows (Project > Your project > ... > Workflows ). These can help with simple things like adding an issue to a project when it is created

## Issue & PR tempaltes
This repository has a few issue and one PR template configured that I have found helpful, in a repository coppied from this one, you should be albe to play around with them and see how you like it.
